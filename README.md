# Welcome to Walle Tunes

Hello there, this is my first django project by my own, still trying to improve
in the basic stuff but so far long I think it's good enough. 
I wasn't sure what to do as a first project, after a few of ideas I decided to do
a music store, I wanted to do like a full music store where people can sign in and
buy the cds/vinyls (even though I don't know the real prices) and maybe an admin
pages to add, update, and delete albums. But it ended just as a collection of my
favorites albums and songs (although I kept the price and formats of the albums). 
Hope you enjoy it, open to sugestions, comments and criticisms, but don't be too 
bad :( 
Having saying that. Welcome to Walle Tunes
